# Operational route planning under uncertainty for Demand Adaptive Systems

## Description

The goal of this software is to determine the solution of an operational route planning problem under uncertainty for Demand Adaptive Systems.

This software contains four folders: `data`, `generators`, `results`, `solver`. 
- `generators`: contains data for the case study of our paper.
- `helper`: helps to load a scenario.
- `results`: information for runs gets saved here
- `solver`: contains three solvers, i.e., our exact decomposition, heuristic, and greedy approaches


## Results

The results in the paper were generated by this software that had been carried out using Python 3.8.11 and Gurobi 9.5 on a desktop computer with Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9900, 3.1 GHz CPU and 4 GB of RAM, running
Ubuntu 20.04.


## Replicating
To replicate the results of an instance of our case study run `python ./run_all.py [route] [route_time] [comp_perc] [num_scenarios] [walking_distance] [util_value] [algorithm] [seed]`.
The following input arguments are valid:

| Argument | Inputs |
| --- | --- |
| route |[55, 155] |
| route_time | for 55: '18_56_00' or '13_50_00'; for 155: '13_50_00' or '18_56_00' |
| comp_perc | 0 <= comp_perc <= 1 |
| num_scenarios | 0 <= num_scenarios <= 40 |
| walking_distance | [100, 150, 250, 300, 350, 400] |
| util_value | [500, 750, 1000] |
| algorithm | ['exact', 'heuristic', 'greedy'] |
| seed | positive integer |

Running an instance from route 55, at route_time 18_56_00, comp_perc 0.9, num_scenarios 5, walking_distance 250, util_value 750, algorithm 'exact', and seed 5  can be done via 
`python .\run_all.py  55 18_56_00 0.9 5 250 750 'exact' 5`
